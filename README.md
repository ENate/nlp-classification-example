# Text classification 

Text mining/document classification examples in python and tensorflow. The goal is to vectorize, transform and train a text documents to classify essential outcomes via supervised and unsupervised learning.

The training data used is downloaded from different data sources (publicly available data sets). We begin with training data which are available in the ``` sklearn (scikit-learn) ``` and nltk packages.

## Contents of the repository

The repository consists of the following structure

``` - misc_files:  ```  Examples of text classification models implemented in Python and nltk packages.

``` - text_mining_news: ``` Tensorflow, python, scikit-learn, text classification examples

To run:un ```python classify.py``` and supply the data assuming the environment has been properly configured.
