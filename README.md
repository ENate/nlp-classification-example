# Text classification

This repository contains notes, discussions and models implemented using neural networks, recurrent (RNN), Long term short memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) deep learning architectures. I explore the basics of RNNs, LSTMs and CNN with examples and identify key aspects, where these architectures have been applied to solve problems.

## Main Tech Stack

- Python and associated libraries (Numpy, Sklearn, Pandas etc)
- Tensorflow and Pytorch
- Opencv for computer vision examples
- Docker and kubernetes

### Main definitions

We revisit neural networks and their application in solving various tasks.
 classification examples in python and tensorflow. The goal is to vectorize, transform and train a text documents to classify essential outcomes via supervised and unsupervised learning.

The training data used is downloaded from different data sources (publicly available data sets). We begin with training data which are available in the ``` sklearn (scikit-learn) ``` and nltk packages.

## Contents of the repository

The repository consists of the following structure

```- misc_files:```  Examples of text classification models implemented in Python and nltk packages.

``` - lstm_cnn_trainer: ```

This folder contains LSTM and CNN examples implemented using Tensorflow, python, scikit-learn, text classification examples

To run:un ```python classify.py``` and supply the data assuming the environment has been properly configured.
