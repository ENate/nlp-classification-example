### Introduction
Recent advancement in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) have been characterized by the evolution of transformers and transformer based models. We present its implementation from scratch using information from other blog posts, tutorials and literature. The aim is to explain terms which are associated with working with transformer based models. The main focus of this tutorial is to identify the application of transformers to natural language processing (NLP). We also include resources and tech stack that are essential in learning, implementing and applying transformer based models. The tools presented in this work are based on personal choice due to popularity.
