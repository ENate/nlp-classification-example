A text mining/document classification example in python and tensorflow. The goal is to vectorize, transform and train a text documents to classify essential outcomes via supervised and unsupervised learning.

The training data used is downloaded from different data sources (publicly available data sets). We begin with training data which are available in the sklearn (scikit-learn) and nltk packages.

The repository consists of the following structure

- misc_files
- text_mining_news

Just run classify.py and suppy the data. Code can also be extended to similar applications.
